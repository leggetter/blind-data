# Blind Data

Blind Data was created a Culture Hack Scotland 2013.

The purpose of the application is to facilitate the discovery and exploration of data, and to create links between one or more pieces of data. These new links then become data themselves, and can also be discovered and linked to.

## Data Discovery

The initial release allows for data can be discovered via text search only. The plan was to allow for a more visual discovery of data.

## Technology

This repository contains the web application which is built using [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

The data is retrived from a web service which was created to make all the Culture Hack Scotland available through a single API endpoint.

## Future

Depending on demand this may be developed further.

* Security: Meteor provides a way of securing data. BlindData doesn't presently implement this.
* Visualisation of linked data for exploration
* Include additional sources of information within the search.
